Phil), and NYU (J.D.)<br><br> <br>Presentation Topic: US-China Disputes and Effect on Cross-Border Cooperation<br>Abstract:  The U.S. has long complained to China's leaders about China's policies on intellectual property protection, foreign trade, government subsidies for certain industries, cybersecurity, and the growing power of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) as it continues to modernize and expand.  The world's two largest economies are now locked in a growing trade war of tariffs, counter-tariffs and other retaliatory measures that have damaged both importers and exporters.  Since taking office, the Trump Administration has chosen to escalate the  confrontation of China in many ways that are disrupting trade and investment, research and development, joint ventures, global supply chains, higher education, and immigration, among other areas.  One of the most visible clashes centers around the Administration's actions against Huawei Technologies, China's most prominent technology company and the world's largest telecommunications equipment producer.  Augustine will discuss these developments with a focus on the potential impacts for Chinese American engineers and their families.  As an attorney in Dorsey's national security practice group, Augustine has "hands-on" experience with many of these issues, as well as prior government enforcement experience as an attorney for U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), an agency of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.</p><a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/surfbort-with-so-pitted-monsterwatch-tickets-68037488961?aff=ebapi">Surfbort with So Pitted + MONSTERWATCH</a><br><p>Sunday, September 15, 2019</p><p>Surfbort with So Pitted + MONSTERWATCH</p><a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/cieusa-seattle-2019-convention-education-seminars-tickets-71470441013?aff=ebapi">CIE/USA-Seattle 2019 Convention -- Education Seminars</a><br><p>Sunday, September 15, 2019</p><p>CIE Annual Convention - Education Seminar Track<br> <br>Theme: College admission strategies for Asian American students and youth leadership development<br> <br>Time: 1:00pm  -  4:00pm<br> <br>Venue: Lake Washington Room<br> <br>In this ever-changing atmosphere, we, Chinese Americans, are facing new challenges: the introduction of SAT Adversary Score to college admission, the pass of Washington's I-1000, the US-China trade war and fragile relationship, etc. <br>What are the potential impacts of these challenges for Chinese Americans especially for the Chinese American youth?

Imagine all of your senses uniting on a truly unique journey through movement, sound, and taste! It's yours to experience at Music + Yoga, a sensory experience presented by the Sustain Music Project.

The afternoon begins with a yoga class led by Dikla Kafka. Even if you've never practiced yoga before, you'll find yourself focusing on the senses—how to ground yourself as you respond to how your body feels, as you breathe deeply and soften your gaze inwards, and as you empty your mind of extraneous thoughts.  


Adding a unique twist, this immersive experience will be paired with live music for flute and marimba, contributing to the sense of listening. You'll connect to the music and let it guide your movements. Beginning with Bach and Schubert and journeying through newer compositions written in the 20th and 21st centuries, the music will follow the arc of the yoga class through pranayama (breathing), flow, seated poses, and shavasana.



Afterwards there will be a time to reflect on the class and connect with other participants through an hour of wine tasting featuring three wines from the local Kirkland winery, Northwest Cellars. A fitting trio of Fortissimo (a red), Leggiero (a rosé), and a Chardonnay complete the music-themed event. Be part of the community with us!


Ticket price includes a 75 minute yoga class with live music and three tasting glasses of wine. No prior yoga experience required; please bring your own mat.
